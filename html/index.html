    <h1>Dice Game</h1>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1 Player</h3>
    <ul><li> Roll the dice to begin the game.</li>
        <li> The dice appears on the first roll.</li>
        <li> When a dice is rolled, the score adds up.</li>
        <li> Once the score passes 20, you win.</li>
        <li> However, if you hit ‘1’ then you lose (if less than score of 20).</li>
        <li> If the player won or lost, the player can start the game again.</li>
        <li> You may want to change the score to any number other than 20</li></ul>
    <h3>2 Player</h3>
    <ul><li> Click ‘New Game’ to begin.</li>
        <li> Player 1 goes first. You can roll the dice however many times you
        wish.</li>
        <li>In the ‘Current’ box, it gives you the current score as you roll the
        dice.</li>
        <li>When it hits a certain score, player 1 may want to ‘hold’ the
        score, which will then appear in the middle of player 1 as the total
        score so for, player 1 cannot roll anymore. Player 2 begins to roll.</li>
        <li> If the player hits ‘1’ without holding any score, the current score
        will reset, and the next player begins to roll again.</li>
        <li> Once one of the players hits 20 or more score, that player wins!</li></ul>
